It was really fun building this dark-theme website.

The tutorial for this video is on my youtube channel, [Click Here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRWxkcKlKLkUyO5I5VlQivg) to watch.

# Folder Structure

You can find the UI Design in `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design to work to. You will also find all the required images and svg assets in the `/images` folder.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

There is a `All Text Website.txt` for all the text used in the website.
